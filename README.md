# Creditcoin Docker for macOS

This project is a collection of scripts for easily setting up and managing Creditcoin nodes using Docker and OrbStack in a macOS environment.

## Key Features

- Creditcoin 3.x node setup and management with unified `addnode.sh`
- Creditcoin 2.x legacy node support
- **In-place node upgrade with session key preservation** (NEW!)
- Node cleanup and removal
- Various options support: telemetry activation/deactivation, custom node names, pruning settings, etc.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- macOS operating system
- Administrator privileges (required for some installation steps)

### Setup

1. Install utility scripts:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

2. Apply changes:

```bash
# zsh (default macOS shell)
source ~/.zshrc

# or bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

3. OrbStack Configuration:
   - OrbStack must be managed through the **desktop application**.
   - After installation, open OrbStack.app and complete the initial setup.
   - Enable the auto-start option in the OrbStack app settings to start on system boot.

## Usage

### Node Creation and Management

```bash
./addnode.sh <node_number> [options]

# Options:
#   -v, --version      Node version (default: 3.52.0-mainnet)
#   -l, --legacy       Use Creditcoin 2.x legacy version
#   -t, --telemetry    Enable telemetry (default: disabled)
#   -n, --name         Node name (default: 3Node<number>)
#   -p, --pruning      Pruning value setting (default: 0, no option added if 0)
#   --upgrade          Upgrade existing node (preserves session keys)

# Creation examples:
./addnode.sh 0                        # Create 3node0 with default settings
./addnode.sh 1 -v 3.32.0-mainnet      # Create with specific version
./addnode.sh 2 -t                     # Create with telemetry enabled
./addnode.sh 3 -n ValidatorA          # Create with custom name
./addnode.sh 4 -p 1000                # Create with pruning value 1000

# Upgrade examples:
./addnode.sh 0 --upgrade               # Upgrade 3node0 to latest version
./addnode.sh 1 --upgrade -v 3.52.0-mainnet  # Upgrade to specific version
```

### Legacy Node Support (Creditcoin 2.x)

```bash
# Create legacy node
./addnode.sh <node_number> -l [options]

# Examples:
./addnode.sh 0 -l                      # Create node0 with Creditcoin 2.x
./addnode.sh 1 -l -v 2.230.2-mainnet   # Specific legacy version

# Upgrade legacy node
./addnode.sh 0 -l --upgrade            # Upgrade to latest 2.x version
```

### Node Upgrade

The `--upgrade` flag allows in-place upgrades while preserving:
- Session keys (validator credentials)
- Chain data
- Node configuration

```bash
# Upgrade single node
./addnode.sh 0 --upgrade               # Upgrade to default version
./addnode.sh 1 --upgrade -v 3.52.0-mainnet  # Upgrade to specific version

# Upgrade process:
1. Automatically backs up session keys
2. Updates docker-compose.yml
3. Pulls new Docker image
4. Restarts node with new version
5. Verifies session key preservation
```

### Node Cleanup

```bash
# Creditcoin 2.0 legacy node cleanup
./cleanup2.sh

# Creditcoin 3.0 node cleanup
./cleanup3.sh
```

## Utility Commands

After running the setup script, the following commands become available:

### Node Management Commands

- `status` - Display a summary of all nodes' status
- `infoAll` - Show detailed information for all running nodes
- `checkVersion [node_name]` - Check node version
- `checkHealth [node_name]` - Check node health status
- `checkName [node_name]` - Check node name

- `checkChain [node_name]` - Check chain status
- `getLatestBlock [node_name]` - Get latest block info
- `rotatekey [node_name]` - Rotate session keys
- `payout [node_name]` - Execute payout for a specific node
- `payoutAll` - Execute payouts for all running 3.0 nodes
- `payoutAllLegacy` - Execute payouts for all running 2.0 nodes
- `genkey [node_name]` - Generate node keys

### Docker Management Commands
- `cdcd` - Navigate to the Creditcoin Docker directory
- `dps` - List running containers
- `dpsa` - List all containers (including stopped ones)
- `dstats` - Show resource usage of containers
- `dip` - Show container IP addresses
- `drestart [container]` - Restart a container
- `dstop [container]` - Stop a container
- `dstart [container]` - Start a container
- `dlog [container]` - Show container logs
- `restartAll` - Restart all running nodes
- `stopAll` - Stop all running nodes
- `startAll` - Start all stopped nodes

### Session Keys Management Commands

## Session Keys Management

Session keys are essential for validator operations. The utility provides two commands for securely managing session keys:

1. **Backing Up Session Keys**:
   ```bash
   backupkeys 3node0
   ```
   This command will:
   - Stop the node if it's running (after confirmation)
   - Backup session keys to a tar.gz file in the current directory
   - Restart the node if it was running

2. **Restoring Session Keys**:
   ```bash
   restorekeys ./3node0-keys-20250507-1234.tar.gz 3node1
   ```
   This command will:
   - Stop the target node if it's running (after confirmation)
   - Backup existing keys (if any)
   - Restore session keys from the backup file
   - Ask to restart the node

**Important**: Never run two nodes with the same session keys simultaneously, as this could result in slashing penalties.

## General Precautions

- Cleanup scripts delete all related containers, images, volumes, and directories. Backing up your data before use is recommended.
- The `dkill` command completely removes a specific node by stopping the container, removing it, and deleting all associated data.
- Sufficient system resources are required for node operation.
- When telemetry is enabled, node information is made public to the Creditcoin network.

## macOS Specific Notes

- These scripts are specifically optimized for macOS environments
- OrbStack must be managed through the desktop application
- OrbStack should be configured to start automatically at system boot (set in app settings)
- If accessing via SSH from a remote server, first run the OrbStack.app on local macOS to complete the initial setup
